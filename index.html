          <h3>What is Accessibility?</h3>
          <p>Accessibility refers to the design of products, devices, services,
          or environments for people who experience disabilities. The concept of
          accessible design and practice of accessible development ensures both
          "direct access" (i.e. unassisted) and "indirect access" meaning
          compatibility with a person's assistive technology (for example,
          <strong>computer screen readers</strong><sup>[1]</sup>).<sup>[2]</sup>

          <h4>Nearly 1 in 5 People Have a Disability in the U.S., Census Bureau
          Reports<sup>[3]</sup></h4>
          <p>About 56.7 million people &mdash; 19 percent of the population
          &mdash; had a disability in 2010, according to a broad definition of
          disability, with more than half of them reporting the disability was
          severe, according to a comprehensive report on this population
          released today by the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
          <p>[In 2012,] the report shows that 41 percent of those age 21 to 64
          with any disability were employed, compared with 79 percent of those
          with no disability.</p>
